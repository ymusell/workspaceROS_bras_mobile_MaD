Slam package:

The slam method used is the default one, Gmapping.  
Some of the parameters have been changed in order to match to the environement of the Chaire. This is a small and narrow space, and we can have a good time interval between updating the map.  
All the map will be saved in the file ~/DOCS/Cartes
